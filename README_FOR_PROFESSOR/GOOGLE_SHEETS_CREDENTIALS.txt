Google Sheets API Setup

This project uses the Google Sheets API for accessing spreadsheet data. To use this feature, you need to provide your own Google API credentials.
Important

The google_sheet/credentials.json file is not included in this repository for security reasons. You must generate your own credentials and place the file in the google_sheet folder before running the project.
Steps to Set Up Google Sheets API Credentials

    Create a Google Cloud project:

        Visit the Google Cloud Console.

        Create a new project or select an existing one.

    Enable the Google Sheets API:

        Navigate to APIs & Services > Library.

        Search for Google Sheets API.

        Click Enable.

    Create a Service Account:

        Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.

        Click Create Credentials > Service Account.

        Fill in the required details and create the service account.

    Generate a JSON key:

        After creating the service account, go to its Keys section.

        Click Add Key > Create new key.

        Select JSON format and download the file.

    Share the Google Sheet with the Service Account:

        The service account has an email address (e.g., your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com).

        Open the Google Sheet you want to access.

        Share the sheet with this email address with at least Viewer permission.

    Place the credentials file:

        Save the downloaded JSON file as credentials.json.

        Place this file inside the google_sheet directory at the root of the project:

    google_sheet/credentials.json

Run the project:

    After placing the credentials file, run the Docker container or execute the application as instructed.
