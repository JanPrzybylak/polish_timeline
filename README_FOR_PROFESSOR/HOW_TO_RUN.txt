Prerequisites

    Docker and Docker Compose installed on their machine.

Setup Steps

    Clone or extract the project:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_folder>


Add Google Sheets API Credentials:

    Follow the Google Sheets API Setup instructions (see other txt)

    Place the downloaded credentials.json in the google_sheet/ folder.

Build and run the Docker containers:

docker-compose up --build

This command will:

    Build the Docker images

    Launch PostgreSQL and the application containers

    Automatically run scrapers, importers, and start the Flask app

Access the web app:

Open a web browser and go to:

http://localhost:5000


Troubleshooting Tips

    If the app fails to connect to the database, ensure Docker containers are running and healthy.

    If the web page fails to load, verify that the Flask app is running and listening on the correct port.

    Confirm the credentials.json file is correctly placed and valid.

    Ensure the Google Sheet is shared with the service account email.
