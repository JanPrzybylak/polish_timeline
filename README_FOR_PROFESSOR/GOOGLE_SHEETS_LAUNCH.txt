## Step 1: Set up access to the Google Sheets API
Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/

Click "Create Project" → Name it anything you like (for example, Timeline Integration)

In the left menu: "APIs & Services" → "Enable APIs and Services"

Search for Google Sheets API → Click Enable

Then go to: "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"

Click "Create Credentials" → Choose Service account

Fill out the form:

Name: for example, sheet-uploader

Grant access → Select "Basic → Editor"

After creating, click on the service account → Go to the "Keys" tab

Click "Add Key" → "Create new key" → Choose JSON

Download the file — this is your private key (a JSON file).
Save it as credentials.json.

## Step 2: Share the Google Sheet with the service account
Create a new Google Sheet: https://sheets.new

Copy the spreadsheet ID — it’s the part of the URL after /d/, for example:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/**-IT MUST TO BE HERE-**/edit#gid=0

and put this part to srcipt SPREADSHEET_ID = "-HERE-"

In the top-right corner, click the Share (blue button)

At the bottom of the pop-up, click "Share with people and groups"

Paste the email from your service account’s JSON file, for example:

sheet-uploader | @timeline-integration | .iam.gserviceaccount.com

Make sure the access level is Editor

On the right of the email, you'll see a dropdown (usually "Viewer" or "Editor")

Select: Editor

Click the Send button

## Step 3: Run the script

python upload_to_sheets.py
